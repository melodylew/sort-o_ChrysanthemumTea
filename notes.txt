DISCO:
0. The number of passes for all sorts and any arraylist of length n is always n-1. Therefore, we should not use it as a deciding factor for best and worst cases.
1. The number of comparisons in bubble sort will always be the same if the length of the arraylist is the same, regardless of how the elements are arranged.


QCC:
0. What is the purpose of knowing the passes of each sort if they all follow the pattern of n-1, where n is the number of elements in an arraylist?

BUB-QA (Q’s and their A’s from header comment):
 * q0: If a pass requires no swaps, what do you know?
 * a0: We are done!
 * q1: After pass p, what do you know?
 * a1: The beginning p elements are properly sorted!
 * q2: How many passes are necessary to completely sort?
 * a2: length of list - 1

SEL-QA (Q’s and their A’s from header comment):
 * q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
 * a0: n-1
 * q1: What do you know after pass p?
 * a1: p elements are sorted/in the correct position
 * q2: How do you know if sorted?
 * a2: n-1 passes have occurred.
 * q3: What does a pass boil down to?
 * a3: A traversal and a swap.


INS-QA (Q’s and their A’s from header comment):
 * q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
 * a0: n-1
 * q1: What do you know after pass p?
 * a1: p elements in the left partition are sorted
 * q2: How will you know when sorted?
 * a2: when the partition pointer reaches the end
 * q3: What constitues a pass?
 * a3: A selection of a partition element and insertion if necessary
 * q4: What must you track?
 * a4: We must track the partition element.
